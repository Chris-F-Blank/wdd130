<h1> Why should I plan ahead for my rafting adventure?
    <p> For optimal trip arrangements, it is advisable to book your adventure well in advance. If you have specific dates in mind, we recommend securing your spot a year ahead. However, if you have some flexibility, booking six months ahead is usually sufficient.
    </p></h1>

<h2>Is whitewater rafting a safe activity even if I can't swim?
<p> While whitewater rafting involves inherent risks like any adventure sport, we prioritize your safety. Our guides hold certifications in Wilderness First Aid and boast a minimum of three years of rafting experience. The most common injuries occur on land or are sunburn-related. Rest assured, all participants on our commercial rafting trips wear Coast Guard-approved life vests or personal flotation devices (PFDs). We warmly welcome non-swimmers on our trips, and your guide will provide a comprehensive safety briefing before your adventure begins, including instructions on what to do in case you fall out of the raft.</p></h2>

<p> Our package includes all the essential camping gear you'll need. This comprises a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent, cot, eating utensils, and a camping chair. Throughout the day, we provide water and lemonade, and during morning and evening hours, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are available. You are welcome to bring reasonable amounts of beer, liquor, and soft drinks (up to two cans per day). Additionally, you'll be provided with three meals per day, along with snacks.</p></h3>

<h6>Is this adventure suitable for kids? What are the age restrictions?
    <p> Absolutely! Our whitewater rafting trips are designed to delight children of all ages. However, based on our experience, children above the age of 8 tend to enjoy the adventure more (and their parents tend to appreciate it more as well). Some parents express concerns about their children getting bored during extended periods on the boat. Surprisingly, we find that very few children, regardless of age, experience boredom. The areas we traverse during the rafting journey are among the most breathtaking in the world, and there's always something fascinating to discover around each bend. Not to mention the thrill of navigating through exciting rapids. Each raft is accompanied by a knowledgeable guide, who can't resist sharing stories along the way, some of which may even be true!    </p></h6>
