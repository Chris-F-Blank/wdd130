    <p>I know the Church is true, for I always find my way back to it, as if saying Im going back home.
      I also testify of the scriptures and their power and how they can change peoples hearts through the Holy Ghost, 
      which testifies of our Savior Jesus Christ who loves us all so much, that he willingly gave his life to save us from 
      being separated from God. And these things I know and say in the name of Jesus Christ Amen.
